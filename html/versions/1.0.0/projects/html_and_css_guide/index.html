    <h1>introduction</h1>
    <h2>this guide is not done!, video stopped at 4:16</h2>
    <p>This guide is coded in VScode.</p>
    <p>this guide is based on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGTJBPNC-Gw&t=212s">this</a> youtube video.</p>
    <p> this guide is made by Joran Nap</p>
    <br>

    <h2>coding setup:</h2>
    <p>first start by making a folder somewere and open it in VScode, if you don't have VScode installed then install it.</p>
    <p> i recommend you use <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer">this</a> VS code extention so your webpage automaticly updates when saving a file.</p>
    <p>after opening the folder make a file and name it "index.html", this way you don't have to give the file in the search bar becouse a browser automaticly runs the index.html file in the folder.</p>
    <p>then type "!" and press "Tab", this will autoaticly make the main tructure for an html file.</p>
    <br>

    <h2>basic html:</h2>
    <h4>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</h4>
    <p> in the html file you will see "&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;", this tells the browser that its an html document it will automaticly tell the browser that its the newst version</p>
    <!-- &lt; is html for "lesser then symbole" and &gt; is html for "greater then symbole"-->
    <h4>&lt;html&gt; &lt;/html&gt;</h4>
    <p>Everything between &lt;html&gt; &lt;/html&gt; is whats in the html file and everything the browser needs to show the webpage.</p>
