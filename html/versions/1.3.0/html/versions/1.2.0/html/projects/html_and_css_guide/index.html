    <h1>introduction</h1>
    <h2>this guide is not done!, video stopped at 8:00</h2>
    <p>This guide is coded in VScode.</p>
    <p>this guide is based on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGTJBPNC-Gw&t=212s">this</a> youtube video, aditional information is from <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/">www.w3schools.com</a>.</p>
    <p> this guide is made by Joran Nap.</p>

    <h2>coding setup:</h2>
    <p>first start by making a folder somewere and open it in VScode, if you don't have VScode installed then install it.</p>
    <p> i recommend you use <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer">this</a> VS code extention so your webpage automaticly updates when saving a file.</p>
    <p>after opening the folder make a file and name it "index.html", this way you don't have to give the file in the search bar becouse a browser automaticly runs the index.html file in the folder. this is a self closing tag.</p>
    <p>then type "!" and press "Tab", this will autoaticly make the main tructure for an html file.</p>
    <hr>

    <h2>basic html:</h2>
    <h4>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</h4>
    <p> In the html file you will see "&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;", this tells the browser that its an html document it will automaticly tell the browser that its the newst version</p>
    <!-- &lt; is html for "lesser then symbole" and &gt; is html for "greater then symbole"-->
    <br>

    <h4>&lt;html&gt; &lt;/html&gt;</h4>
    <p>Everything between &lt;html&gt; &lt;/html&gt; is whats in the html file and everything the browser needs to show the webpage.</p>
    <br>

    <h4>&lt;head&gt; &lt;/head&gt;</h4>
    <p>Everything between &lt;head&gt; &lt;/head&gt; is informatio about the webpage. Examples of things it includes are the title and a link to the css file.</p>
    <br>

    <h4>&lt;title&gt; &lt;/title&gt;</h4>
    <p>Everything between &lt;title&gt; &lt;/title&gt; is the title of the web page, this one is called "html & css guide" as you can see on the top of your screen.</p>
    <br>

    <h4>&lt;h1&gt; &lt;/h1&gt;</h4>
    <p>Everything between &lt;h1&gt; &lt;/h1&gt; is a heading, you have 6 headings, each one smaller then the one before, here are some examples:</p>
    <h1>this is h1</h1>
    <h2>this is h2</h2>
    <h3>this is h3</h3>
    <h4>this is h4</h4>
    <h5>this is h5</h5>
    <h6>this is h6</h6>
    <br>

    <h4>&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</h4>
    <p>Everything between &lt;p&gt; and &lt;/p&gt; is a paragraph, you display text in it, here is an Example:</p>
    <p>this is an paragraph</p>
    <p>if you want some sample text in VScode then you can type "lorem" and then press tab, this will place this text:</p>
    <p>"Lorem ipsum dolor sit, 
        amet consectetur adipisicing elit. 
        Incidunt, accusantium qui quis animi maxime 
        corporis laboriosam ratione error aliquid illo reprehenderit ducimus 
        nihil nam explicabo sit ut eaque vel         veritatis."
    </p>
    <p>a paragraph doesnt care about how its structured in the code, it doesnt matter if you have too many spaces, blank lines or muliple rows, everything between the  &lt;p&gt; and &lt;/p&gt; and for example the lorem... above this look like this in the code:</p>
    <pre>
        &lt;p&gt;"Lorem ipsum dolor sit, 
            amet consectetur adipisicing elit. 
            Incidunt, accusantium qui       quis animi maxime 
            corporis laboriosam ratione error aliquid illo reprehenderit ducimus 
            nihil nam explicabo sit ut eaque vel         veritatis."
        &lt;/p&gt;
    </pre>
    <p>paragraphs are seperated with a blank line.</p>
    <br>
    
    <h4>&lt;pre&gt; &lt;/pre&gt;</h4>
    <p>Everything between &lt;pre&gt; and &lt;/pre&gt; is preformatted text meaning every new row and every meant space is already typed in it. for example this is how lorem... looks in multiple rows:</p>
    <pre>
Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit.
Dolor tempore necessitatibus delectus, 
pariatur quis inventore beatae excepturi omnis deleniti ullam voluptate tenetur laboriosam voluptatem rerum quo aut magnam?
Nihil, nemo?
    </pre>
    <br>
    
    <h4>&lt;br&gt;</h4>
    <p>&lt;br&gt; is a self closing tag meaning you dont have to close it. &lt;br&gt; is used for blank lines in html pages, you can also call it blank row, this is ued between every subject on the page.</p>
    <br>
    
    <h4>&lt;hr&gt;</h4>
    <p>&lt;hr&gt; is a self closing tag meaning you dont have to close it. &lt;hr&gt; is used for lines in html pages, here is how it looks:</p>
    <hr>
    <p>&lt;hr&gt; can be used for cleaner looks of a webpage and readablility.</p>
    <br>
</html>
